### CC-Archives
Beginner c++ codes for ease-to-medium level practice questions. <br>
This repo has been created to track my own competitive programming journey. So forgive me if any errors do arise.

#### How To Use
1. Clone the repository to a local system.
2. Refer to the code inside by matching the particular file names with (for eg. CodeForces) questions.

<strong>Note :</strong> You may view it online on [GitHub](https://github.com/bit-by-bits/CC-Archives) as well. <br>
A better approach would be to read the code halfway and only take enough hints to solve the questions, instead of copying directly.
